## About

This repository contains Java-based solutions to common problems related to:

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Array manipulation (e.g., finding missing numbers, rotating arrays)
- String manipulation (e.g., checking for anagrams)
- Other fundamental algorithms and data structure-related problems.

The goal is to provide clean, understandable code to help developers practice and improve their DSA skills.

## Technologies

The following technologies and languages are used in this repository:

- **Java** (100%)

## Project Structure

The repository contains individual Java files for each algorithm or problem. Here's an overview of some of the files (new algorithms are regularly added):

```plaintext
├── AnagramString.java            # Check if two strings are anagrams
├── ArrayWave.java                # Arrange an array in a wave-like fashion
├── BinarySearch.java             # Binary search algorithm
├── BubbleSort.java               # Bubble sort algorithm
├── MergeSort.java                # Merge sort algorithm
├── NextGreaterElement.java       # Find the next greater element in an array
└── TwoSumProblem.java            # Solve the two-sum problem
```

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Java installed. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arjunkhatipatel/dsa.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd dsa
   ```

3. Compile and run any Java file:
   ```bash
   javac <filename>.java
   java <filename>
   ```

## Usage

You can explore each algorithm by running the corresponding `.java` file. For example, to test the Bubble Sort algorithm, you can compile and run `BubbleSort.java`:

```bash
javac BubbleSort.java
java BubbleSort
```

You can similarly test other algorithms to better understand their implementation and performance.
